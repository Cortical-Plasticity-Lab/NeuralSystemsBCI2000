\chapter{System Overview}

While BCIs can differ widely in the nature of the physiological components they 
use, in the signal processing they perform, in the feedback they provide, or in 
the underlying training and operation paradigm, they all need the same four 
elements: EEG data collection, signal processing, an output device and manual or 
automatic parameterization and configuration. Therefore, it seems to be a 
natural choice to partition the system into four modules with respective 
functionality. Figure \ref{mod_overview} illustrates a high--level overview of 
this partitioning scheme. 

It is conceivable that for certain BCIs, the chosen decomposition might be 
overkill, or even unfavorable, but still it seemed to be the most appropriate 
for a variety of systems.
