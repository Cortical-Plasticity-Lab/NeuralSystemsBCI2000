\textbf{Real Time} \\

There are many definitions of the term \textit{real time}. One example (as 
presented on http://www.zdwebopedia.com/TERM/r/real\_time.html) is:

Occurring immediately. The term is used to describe a number of 
different computer features. For example, real--time operating systems are 
systems that respond to input immediately. They are used for such tasks as 
navigation, in which the computer must react to a steady flow of new information 
without interruption. Most general--purpose operating systems are not real--time 
because they can take a few seconds, or even minutes, to react.

Real time can also refer to events simulated by a computer at the same speed 
that they would occur in real life. In graphics animation, for example, a 
real--time program would display objects moving across the screen at the same 
speed that they would actually move.
