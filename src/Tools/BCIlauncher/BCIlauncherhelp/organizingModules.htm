<h1>Organizing BCI2000 Programs with BCIlauncher</h1>
<p>BCIlauncher reads in the BCIlauncher.ini file contents, which organizes known BCI2000 programs by module; that is, they are organized into source, signal processing, and application modules. The contents of this file are then compared to what is actually present in the BCI2000\prog folder, whose contents are placed in the appropriate list. For example, the default BCIlauncher.ini file places the d2box.exe and P3AV.exe programs in the &quot;app&quot; category. If the BCI2000\prog directory contains the d2box.exe file, but not the P3AV.exe file, then only the d2box.exe file appears in the &quot;app&quot; list. Furthermore, if a *.exe file is found in the prog folder but is not present in the BCIlauncher.ini file, then that program is placed in the &quot;Others&quot; list.</p>
<p>This organization is not static, and can easily be changed. First, it is possible to change the position of a particular program within a list by drag-and-dropping it to a different position in the list. This is useful if one program is used more often than the others, particularly with the Acquisition modules. This helps because the first item in each list is automatically highlighted at the program startup, so commonly used programs at the top of the list can be started immediately with the Launch button. In addition, the BCIlauncher.ini file is always updated to reflect the contents of each list, so that their location in the list is the same for each run (unless they are moved again).</p>
<p>Programs can be moved from one list to another by selecting the item from a list, right-clicking on the item, and selecting the destination list. </p>
