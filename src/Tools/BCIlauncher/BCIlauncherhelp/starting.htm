<h1>Starting a BCI Session</h1>
<p>When the desired modules have been selected from the lists, press the Launch! button to start the programs. The status of each program is given in the Status box. First, the operator module starts, including any startup parameters passed to it. Each selected BCI2000 core module will then connect to the Operator, allowing you to then load or modify a parameter file to get started. </p>

<p>Note that it is not necessary to select a program from each list on startup. By pressing the Clear All button, all list selections will be cleared, allowing one or more modules to be omitted from startup. The desired module can then be started from the prog folder, or can be started in Borland for source code debugging purposes.</p>
<p>Additionally, multiple programs in the Others list can be started as well if selected, which may be useful if an external program is often used in conjunction with a BCI session. </p>
