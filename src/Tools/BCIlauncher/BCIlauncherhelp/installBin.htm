<h1>Installing from a Precompiled Binary</h1>
<p>By default, when BCI2000 is compiled in distributed, the necessary files should be placed in the correct locations. BCIlauncher requires two files: BCIlauncher.exe, and BCIlauncher.ini, and both should be located in the {path to BCI2000}\BCI2000\prog folder. BCIlauncher.ini contains the information for categorizing known BCI2000 executables, all of which should also be found in the prog folder. </p>

<p>If BCIlauncher is unable to find the *.ini file, then you will have the chance to choose a new one; the original file is included in the {path to BCI2000}\BCI2000\src\tools\BCIlauncher directory, and can be selected. BCIlauncher will then create a new *.ini file in the correct location.</p>
