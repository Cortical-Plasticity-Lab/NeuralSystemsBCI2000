<h1>Installing from Source</h1>
<p>The Borland compiler is necessary to compile the BCIlauncher program. The Borland Project file (BCIlauncher.bpl) is included in the BCI2000\src\tools\BCIlauncher directory, and is the most simple method of compiling the program. In addition, it will also be included in a command-prompt compilation, by issuing the "make" command in the BCI2000\src directory.</p>

<p>By default (and by necessity), the BCIlauncher executable is placed in the BCI2000\prog directory after compilation. BCI2000 should be distributed with the BCIlauncher.ini file, which is necessary for running the program, but a backup copy can also be found in the BCI2000\src\tools\BCIlauncher directory as well. </p>
