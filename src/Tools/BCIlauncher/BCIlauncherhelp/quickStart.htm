<h1>Quick Start for BCIlauncher</h1>

<h3>NOTE: If you encounter problems using the quick start, go to the Installation Help, and make sure that the necessary files are located in the correct locations. </h3>

<p>After installing the BCIlauncher executable, run the program by double clicking on the BCIlauncher.exe file. Assuming that the BCIlauncher.ini file is found, the program should appear. </p>

<p>The program shows 3 lists of different programs, categorized by the BCIlauncher.ini file, and corresponding to one of the three necessary modules for a BCI2000 session. The &quot;Others&quot; list has the programs that were not categorized by the BCIlauncher.ini file. To start a session, simply select one program from the Acquistion, Signal Processing, and Application lists. Then, press the &quot;Launch&quot; button in the Status panel. The BCI2000 Operator program is started, then the source, signal processing, and application modules start and connect to the Operator. If everything works, the BCI session should be ready to begin.</p>

<p>For more information about supplying startup parameters and for categorizing programs, see the Using the BCI2000 Launcher section. </p>
