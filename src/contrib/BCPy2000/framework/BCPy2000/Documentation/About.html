From the developer's point of view, the implementation is carried out in <a class="local canonical" title="Python" href="Python.html">python</a>, taking advantage of various high-level packages: <a class="local" href="VisionEgg.html">VisionEgg</a> for stimulus presentation, <a class="local" href="NumPy.html">NumPy</a> and <a class="local" href="SciPy.html">SciPy</a> for signal processing and classification, and <a class="local" href="IPython.html">IPython</a> for interactive debugging.</p><p>Being a BCI2000 system, it is modular. This means you can choose to use python for the Application module, and/or the Signal Processing module, and/or the Signal Source module, entirely as you please, and use other pre-existing BCI2000 modules for the remainder of the system.</p><p>BCPy2000 is aimed at <a class="local canonical" title="Developer" href="Developer.html">developers</a>. Currently, our emphasis is on getting you to the stage where you can implement a BCI2000 module based entirely on your own python code. We provide a lot of infrastructure to allow you to do so quickly, but the details of exactly how you classify your signals, or how you arrange your stimuli in space and time, are going to be left to you. We do provide a <a class="local canonical" title="Demo" href="Demo.html">demo</a> implementation which makes use of some <a class="local canonical" title="Tools" href="Tools.html">optional higher-level tools</a> that you may also find useful. However, the optional tools are currently only patchily documented. We're sure your own implementations will be better anyway.</p><p>To learn more, you may wish to take a look at how the system is <a class="local canonical" title="Structure" href="Structure.html">structured</a>.</p></div><div class="footer"><hr /> <span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="About.html">About</a> <a class="local" href="Download.html">Download</a> <a class="local" href="Structure.html">Structure</a> <a class="local" href="Demo.html">Demo</a> <a class="local" href="Hooks.html">Hooks</a> <a class="local" href="API.html">API</a> <a class="local" href="Support.html">Support</a> <a class="local" href="Credits.html">Credits</a> <a class="local" href="License.html">License</a> </span> <span class="edit"></span> <span class="time"><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2008-09-25 13:02 UTC by <a class="author" title="from localhost" href="jez.html">jez</a> <a class="diff">(diff)</a></span></span></div></body></html>
