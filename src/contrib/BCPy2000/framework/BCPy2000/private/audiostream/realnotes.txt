	* impedance view for our different montage
	* photos of correct cap and headphone placement
	* murphy-proof headphone construction:  accidentally swapping L&R could be a disaster

double-click to start calibration session

	calibration with Wadsworth tech present:  could be verbal, with keypress trigger
	but even if so, subsequent calibration without tech must be automated:   subject hears audio prompts
		* so create audio prompts (must be adapted to individual streaming-stimuli)

	with Wadsworth tech present:  subject could receive verbal feedback on counting task result
		parameterize: constant display of which side should be attended, and what the correct count is
	without Wadsworth tech:  subject receives no feedback about counting task (we must just assume they have got the hang of counting by now)
		or: implement audio feedback about the count
		
		
	creation of weights must happen automatically
	loading of weights must happen automatically
	
	after first weights are loaded:
		inform subject about the bell feedback
	
	judge somehow which runs are "good" (to be included in the training) and which not
