photos of correct cap and headphone placement
	murphy-proof headphone construction:  accidentally swapping L&R could be a disaster
impedance view for our different montage

double-click to start calibration

	calibration with Wadsworth tech present:  could be verbal, with keypress trigger
	but even if so, subsequent calibration without tech must be automated:   subject hears audio prompts
		so create audio prompts (must be adapted to individual streaming-stimuli)

	with Wadsworth tech present:  subject could receive verbal feedback on counting task result
		parameterize: constant display of which side should be attended, and what the correct count is
	without Wadsworth tech:  subject receives no feedback about counting task (we must just assume they have got the hang of counting by now)

	creation of weights must happen automatically
	loading of weights must happen automatically
	
	after first weights are loaded:
		inform subject about the bell feedback
	
	judge somehow which runs are "good" (to be included in the training) and which not
